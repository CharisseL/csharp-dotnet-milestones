#Veternary Clinic

## Setup

1) Open Visual Studio and create a new empty MVC project.
2) Make a new SQL database.


## Instructions
This exercise mocks the opperations of a veterinarian's office.  Make an MVC application that does the following:

1) Outputs a list of Pets that includes the pet's Name, Animal Type, Breed (if applicable), Owner and Veternarian.
2) Each pet should include a human owner and a veternarian.
3) Poplulate the tables with example data, giving each veternatian several patients and some humans more than one pet.



## Requirements

1) Make at least 3 tables.
2) Use LINQ to join the 3 tables to retrieve the data for the list.
3) Output a list to the browser of pets that at minimum includes their name, owner's name and veternarian's name.  

## Bonus Criteria

1) Make a patient profile view that gives the Name, owner and veternarian of a single animal
2) Make a forth table that lists charges.  Populate this with sample data that gives some owners of multiple pets charges from each pet.  Then use LINQ to make an invoice for the pet owner.
