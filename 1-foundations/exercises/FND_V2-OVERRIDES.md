# Milestone 1 - Exercise V2 - Method Overrides

1) Modify your console app from V1 to include methods for child classes that override the parent class(es) with regard to the noise produced.

E.g.  When a dog (parent class) emits a "woof" noise, a child class ("chihuahua") makes a "yip" sound instead.
