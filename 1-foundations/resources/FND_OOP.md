# Object Oriented Programming

There are four tenets of object oriented programming, and you encountered all of them during your experience with JavaScript, which itself is an object oriented language.

***Inheritance with Classes***  - Receiving properties from a parent.  We taught you in the front end course how to handle inheritance in JavaScript with the prototypal style. In C#, you inherit with classes.

***Polymorphism*** - can solve same problem in multiple different ways.

***Encapsulation*** - All of an object's functions are grouped together at once, in a package or container.

***Abstraction*** - Cohesive organization, layers of abstraction.

### Principles of Object-Oriented Programming
* does Jurnell have Lecture notes?

***Virtual*** - expects override

***Abstract*** - not expected to implement

***`base();`*** - inherit fields and properties from parent, but do not construct new instance

#### Sonda's Notes on Object Oriented Principles
* it exists because this is how humans understand the world.
* every object has an attribute. An attribute is a set of orthogonal features used to uniquely identify an object.
###### Four Main Principles (memorize the things	!):
  * **Inheritance** → the receiving of properties from a parent
  * **Polymorphism** → Jurnell’s Definition: you can solve the same problem in many different ways, meaning there is no one right answer, but many possible ones that leads to the same solution. Eliza’s Definition: a type whose values and properties are similar to other types // the functionality you have in the base class can be propagated through the children
  * **Encapsulation** → packaging code into containers in which others can interact with what’s inside this containers through specific access ways.
  * **Abstraction** → encapsulating code such that it can be used again and again in a general way.

* refactoring is one of the most important tools a developer can have in order to make the software more readable, efficient, etc.
* data structures and linked lists doesn’t necessarily say anything about how you implement it. You will still need a specific way to implement this data to do something meaningful.
