(https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-fundamentals-with-visual-studio-2015/table-of-contents)
5h20m by Scott Allen 9/25/2015
	- Good info about C# language
	- Will be most helpful in milestone 1


##Not Recommended
1. Pretty much everything else. When deciding if a tutorial or resource is worth your time, consider the following factors:
	- Date: make sure the publication date is fairly recent (within the last year or two). Code changes quckly and out-of-date materials won't be very useful
	- Versions: If the versions of Visual Studio, etc are not the same as the ones we're using in class, the information may or may not be useful to you
